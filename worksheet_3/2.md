# 2.1
Write out the definitions of B2U(X) and B2T(X) from the slides, specialized to the case when w (the length of the bit vector X) is 4.

`B2U(X) = x_3 * 8 + x_2 * 4 + x_1 _*2 + x_0 * 1`

`B2T(X) = (x_2 * 4 + x_1 * 2 + x_0 * 1) - (x_3 * 8)`

# 2.2
Complete the following table relating a bit vector X (AKA sequences of binary digits, AKA binary strings) and its unsigned interpretation B2U(X) (see the textbook and slides).

X    | B2U(X)
---- | ------
0000 | 0
0001 | 1
0010 | 2
0011 | 3
0100 | 4
0101 | 5
0110 | 6
0111 | 7
1000 | 8
1001 | 9
1010 | 10
1011 | 11
1100 | 12

# 2.3
2.3 Binary to Two's Complement

Complete the following table relating a bit vector X (AKA sequences of binary digits, AKA binary strings) and its two's complement interpretation B2T(X) (see the textbook and slides).

X    | B2T(X)
---- | ----------
0000 | 0 - 0 = 0
0001 | 1 - 0 = 1
0010 | 2 - 0 = 2
0011 | 3 - 0 = 3
0100 | 4 - 0 = 4
0101 | 5 - 0 = 5
0110 | 6 - 0 = 6
0111 | 7 - 0 = 7
1000 | 0 - 8 = -8
1001 | 1 - 8 = -7
1010 | 2 - 8 = -6
1011 | 3 - 8 = -5
1100 | 4 - 8 = -4
1101 | 5 - 8 = -3
1110 | 6 - 8 = -2
1111 | 7 - 8 = -1

# 2.5
Consider the following program.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main () {
  signed char x = 0x80;
  printf ("x = %x\n", x);

  unsigned char y = 0x80;
  printf ("y = %x\n", y);

  return 0;
}
```

When Alice ran it, she expected to see both x and y printed as 80. Explain what went wrong, and how the program should be altered so that both values are displayed as 80.

Replace `printf ("x = %x\n", x);` with `printf ("x = %x\n", x & 0xff);`
